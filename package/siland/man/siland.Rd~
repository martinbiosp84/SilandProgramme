\title{
Estimation of spatial influence of landscape
}
\description{
siland is used to fit spatial influence of landscape.  
%It can be used to carry out gaussian, exponential or binomial models. 
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
siland(loc.model, land=NULL, data, initSIF = NULL, sif = "exponential", family = "gaussian", test = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{loc.model}{
a symbolic description (see lm() or glm()) of the response variable concerning local variables. Random effects are also allowed according to the syntax in package lme4 (see lmer() function in package lme4).
}
  \item{land}{
a list containing the location of the landscape variables. Each component of the list is a dataframe with two columns "X" and "Y" indicating the locations of pixels for a given landscape variable.
}
  \item{data}{
a dataframe containing the response variable and the local variables.
}
  \item{initSIF}{
a vector indicating the starting values for the estimation of the mean distance of the spatial influence functions. The length of initSIF has to be equal to the length of list land. By default, initialisation is equal to 100 for each landscape variable.
}
  \item{sif}{
the family of the spatial influence function. sif can be "exponential", "gaussian" or "uniform". 
}
  \item{family}{
the distribution of response variable. family can be "gaussian", "poisson" or "binomial" and the associated link function are identity, log and logit respectively.
}
  \item{test}{
logical value. If TRUE, a ratio likelihood test is performed for each explanatory variable (local and spatial). By default, the value is FALSE since performing tests for all the variables can be heavy computing.
